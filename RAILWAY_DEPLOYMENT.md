## üèóÔ∏è Railway-Specific Configuration

### Dockerfile for Railway

Use `backend/Dockerfile.railway` for Railway deployment:

```dockerfile
# Railway-optimized Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=calloutracing.settings

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    postgresql-client build-essential libpq-dev dos2unix curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
COPY start-railway.sh /app/start-railway.sh
RUN dos2unix /app/start-railway.sh && chmod +x /app/start-railway.sh

RUN mkdir -p /app/staticfiles /app/media
RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

EXPOSE $PORT

CMD ["bash", "/app/start-railway.sh"]
```

### Start Script for Railway

Use `backend/start-railway.sh` which:
- Automatically detects Python command (`python` or `python3`)
- Uses Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- Handles database migrations
- Collects static files

## üîß Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Automatic Deployment

Railway will automatically:
- Detect your Django application
- Use the `Dockerfile.railway` if present
- Run the `start-railway.sh` script
- Provide database environment variables
- Handle SSL certificates

### 2. Manual Environment Setup

If you need to set environment variables manually:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add the required environment variables listed above

### 3. Database Setup

Railway automatically:
- Creates a PostgreSQL database
- Provides connection strings
- Handles database migrations via the start script

## üìä Monitoring on Railway

### Logs
- View logs in Railway dashboard
- Real-time log streaming
- Error tracking

### Health Checks
- Railway automatically monitors your application
- Health check endpoint: `/health/`

### Metrics
- CPU and memory usage
- Request/response times
- Error rates

## üîÑ Railway-Specific Commands

### View Logs
```bash
# In Railway dashboard or CLI
railway logs
```

### Run Commands
```bash
# Execute Django commands
railway run python manage.py migrate
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# View current variables
railway variables

# Set variables
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Railway Deployment

### Common Issues

1. **Python Command Not Found**
   - Use `start-railway.sh` which auto-detects Python
   - Ensure `python:3.11-slim` base image

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` automatically
   - Check if database service is running

3. **Static Files Not Serving**
   - Railway serves static files automatically
   - Ensure `collectstatic` runs in start script

4. **Port Issues**
   - Railway uses `PORT` environment variable
   - Application must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Railway environment
railway run env

# Test database connection
railway run python manage.py check --database default

# View application logs
railway logs --follow
```

## üîí Security on Railway

### Automatic Security Features
- SSL/TLS certificates (automatic)
- Environment variable encryption
- Network isolation
- Automatic backups

### Best Practices
- Use Railway's built-in environment variables
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use Railway's secret management
- Enable automatic deployments

## üìà Scaling on Railway

### Automatic Scaling
- Railway scales based on traffic
- Automatic resource allocation
- Pay-per-use pricing

### Manual Scaling
- Adjust resources in Railway dashboard
- Scale database independently
- Add additional services as needed

## üîó Railway CLI

Install Railway CLI for local development:

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link
```
